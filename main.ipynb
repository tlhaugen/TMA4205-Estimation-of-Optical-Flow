    "Optical flow describes the apparent motion of image intensity over time and is used to estimate how points in an image move between two consecutive frames. In this project, the problem is modeled using the Horn–Schunck method, which assumes that the intensity of a point remains constant as it moves. This leads to a linear system of partial differential equations that can be solved numerically after discretization. The work focuses on formulating this system, analyzing its properties, and implementing different numerical approaches to compute the solution, including the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, Gauss–Seidel smoothing, and a multigrid V–cycle.\n"

Consequently, the full system matrix $A$ is symmetric positive definite. While the diagonal and Laplacian contributions stabilize the system, the presence of cross-coupling terms $I_x I_y$ prevents strict diagonal dominance in most cases. \n",

    "The lack of global diagonal dominance implies that the Jacobi and Gauss–Seidel methods are not guaranteed to converge for this system, since their convergence typically relies on the diagonal elements dominating the off-diagonal ones.

And they only converge if the spectral radius, $\\rho$, is less than one, which can only be guaranteed by strict diagonal dominence.

    "The smoother applies a red–black Gauss–Seidel iteration that updates interior pixels alternately by solving a small coupled 2×2 system for each pixel. This reduces high-frequency errors in both u and v while keeping the boundary fixed at zero. After a few pre-smoothing sweeps, the residual r = b − A(u, v) is computed and transferred to a coarser grid using restriction. Restriction is done with full-weighting, averaging neighboring values with weights [1/4, 1/2, 1/4] in both directions. The image derivatives Ix and Iy are restricted in the same way to preserve the structure of the operator.\n",

    "On the coarse grid, the error equation is solved approximately, either by recursion to the next coarser level or, at the coarsest grid, by a small number of Conjugate Gradient iterations. The resulting coarse-grid error is interpolated back to the fine grid through prolongation using bilinear interpolation, and the fine-grid solution is corrected by adding this interpolated error. A few post-smoothing sweeps are then applied to remove the remaining high-frequency errors.\n",

    "Each V–cycle therefore performs pre-smoothing, residual computation, restriction, coarse solve, prolongation, and post-smoothing.
